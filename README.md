### Description

This project allowed us to consolidate and apply the topics covered through this first 8 weeks (from HTML, CSS, JS through APIs). 
In our project we choose to use Google Books APIs and New Tork Times API. 
Our primary aim was to integrate both APIs to be able to do a search with a complete functional app.  
We took the challenge to build a project that is the vivid example of a real work request I would get in a real job.
This webpage is primarly focus to do a search by the favorite or requested authors anyone needs in a particular circunstance.

```
With the previous consideration:
GIVEN a book finder with form inputs
WHEN I search for an author in Google Book.
THEN I am presented with the posibility to order by relevance (default) or newest.
WHEN I type the author and select my prefered order, and send my request by a click.
THEN I am presented with the top 10 (newest or relevant) books of the selected author. The displayed information include title, image of book cover, author, category and date.
WHEN I like the author searched and results, and I click the like icon
THEN I save the search term for future display
WHEN I like the search experience and I click the heart icon
THEN my click will be counted 
WHEN I want to search by best sellers' author I use the New York Times input and after clicking "Go"
THEN I am again presented with best sellers of author selected.
